initialize - git init

when a file is not addedusing the git add command git does not track the file
that means even if we delete the file then git won't say that file deleted when 
we do git status
even if content is changes it won't say content is modified.

Now let's talk about a staged file
so if we staged a file and deleted it we can resotre it using git (no need to go
inside the recycle bin and restore) also if we have commited till c1 and have added 
new content we can restore
git restore --staged
eg- git restore sample


let say we have also commited c2 now we want to switch to c1
do -- git checkout c1

sometimes it may happen that we want to switch to c2 again but
git log does not show the header of it
use git reflog to show all the will display a list of all the recent reference changes, including the commits and HEAD positions

when we directly checkout on a commit our HEAD is detached
that means HEAD does not point to a branch it points to a specific commit
to re attach a HEAD use
git checkout <branch name>

Let's talk about branch checkout
1. we can checkout on tracked files (the one with git add)
2. we cannot checkout on new branches on untracked files 
2. git log is interesting 
eg . commit 3fcc8bc813e34558464015b5a2a3ef341d65d2fe (HEAD -> branch1, master)
The commit 3fcc8bc813e34558464015b5a2a3ef341d65d2fe is the commit that the HEAD is currently pointing to. The (HEAD -> branch1, master) part indicates the current state of the branches.

HEAD -> branch1 means that the HEAD is currently attached to branch1. This indicates that if you make a new commit, branch1 will move forward with that commit.

master refers to the branch named master, and it also points to the same commit 3fcc8bc813e34558464015b5a2a3ef341d65d2fe.

both head->branch1 , master are pointing to the same commit

now we added a commit on branch1 "while on branch1 added branch1 file a commit ahead of master"

we switched back to master and added another commit where we added and commited summary

we again switched back to branch1 where we have not still commited summary
we make another commit

we merge


both head->branch1 , master are pointing to the same commit
